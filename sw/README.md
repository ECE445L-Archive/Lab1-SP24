# README

This is the template project folder for your lab. Feel free to modify the files
in here, as long as they remain in this folder. This is where TAs will look for
when running your project and/or inspecting your code for software quality.

## Project Structure

- examples: folder containing any unit tests or example projects demonstrating
  the functionality of your drivers.
- inc: folder containing any drivers you write or modify from valvanoware
- lib: folder containing any external drivers written by other third parties
- src: folder containing your lab project

## Creating a New Project

The first 6 steps have been done for you in this template repository. Click on
the project file in your explorer to open it up.

1. Open up Keil.
2. Click on the 'Project' tab on the top toolbar.
3. Click on New uVision Project.
4. Create a new .uvproj file of the desired name (typically Lab1, Lab5, etc) in the SW folder.
5. Search for the 'TM4C123GH6PM' device in the 'Select Device for Target 'Target 1' window.
6. Press OK and then press OK again in the 'Manage Run-Time Environment' window.

## Managing Project Files

1. Right click on the 'Target 1' item in the Project sidebar window.
2. Click on 'Manage Project Items' in the submenu.
3. In the 'Files' column, click on the 'Add Files' button.
4. Add the implementation files (.C and .s files) required for the project
   dependencies into the project. This includes your main file. In particular,
   make sure you include the startup.s file, since this includes things like
   interrupt definitions.
