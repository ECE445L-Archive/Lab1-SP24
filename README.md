# EE445L-SP22-Lab-Template
Template for EE445L SP22 Labs.

## HW

The HW folder should contain your schematic and board files for your PCB or circuits. In labs 1-5 and 10, you will be creating schematics for your circuit in EAGLE. A setup tutorial can be found [here](https://www.shawnvictor.net/autodesk-eagle.html).

## SW

The SW folder should contain your application firmware and software written for the lab. The SW/inc folder contains firmware drivers written for you by Professor Valvano. Feel free to write your own (in fact, in some labs, you may be required to write your own).

You can place any other source files in the SW/ folder. TAs will look at the files you create and/or modify for software quality and for running your project.

## Resources

A couple files are provided in the Resources folder so you don't have to keep searching for that one TI document. Some of them are immediately useful, like the TM4C datasheet. Others may be useful for your final project, like the TM4C_System_Design_Guidelines page.

## Git and Github

We will extensively use Git and Github for managing lab projects. This makes it easier for TAs to grade and help debug the project by allowing us to see commit histories, maintain a common project structure, and 
Likewise, it makes it easier for students to collaborate with partners, merge different codebases, and to debug their work by having a history of commits.

Two common ways of using Git and Github are [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and the [command line](https://git-scm.com/downloads). [Tutorials](https://dev.to/mollynem/git-github--workflow-fundamentals-5496) are also abundant on the net for you to peruse. We've provided a cheatsheet for git in the Resources folder.

It is highly recommended to make the most out of Git, even if you've never used it before. Version control will save you a lot of suffering, and tools like Git or SVN are ubiquitous in the industry.
